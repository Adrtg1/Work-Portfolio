# Adrian – Projects & Documentation Hub

Hi! This GitHub repository is a collection of my personal and collaborative projects, where I document my development process and showcase projects

Here you'll find:
-  **Work-in-progress builds** — from independent game development to research-based initiatives  
-  **Completed projects** 

This space serves as a portfolio spanning across my interests in Management, design, social impact, and creative tech.

Co-founder of 16961363 Canada Inc. (Game Studio Company)

Building from the ground up, concept to creation

In 2025 I co-founded 16961363 Canada Inc, an independent studio currently in its pre-production phase. 

**Early Development Stage**

We are currently in the conceptual and planning phase of our first game. 
For now, the project is operating under the codename "Project DF"

Some of our ongoing work includes:

- Story development: Worldbuilding, character arcs, narrative structure.
- Mechanics: Brainstorming gameplay loops, player abilities, and enemy design.
- Competitive research and genre analysis.
- Mood boards, concept sketches, and early art direction.
- Exploring Godot for prototyping.

**My Role**

As co-founder, I currently focus on the business and operational foundation of the studio while guiding early-stage planning efforts

- Project management: Setting timelines, tracking milestones, and coordinating team workflows to keep development aligned and focused.
- Strategic planning: Leading discussions on long-term goals, production scope, and go-to-market strategies.
- Creative direction: Shaping the game’s core vision, genre focus, and player experience alongside the team.
- Business development: Outlining initial funding strategies, researching publishing opportunities, and identifying key partnerships.
- Documentation & organization: Creating our Game Design Documents, pitch decks, and internal planning resources (Notion, Google Docs, GitHub, etc).
- Community groundwork: Exploring brand identity, setting up early social media, and drafting initial marketing plans.

**The Vision** 

We’re building a horror-themed narrative game inspired by titles like SIGNALIS and Darkwood, games that masterfully blend psychological tension, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Our project aims to combine:
- A rich, lived-in, emotionally resonant story with layers of mystery and discovery
- Stylized visuals and atmospheric sound design that heighten immersion and dread
- Tight, intuitive gameplay mechanics that support exploration and tension
- A strong focus on worldbuilding and environmental storytelling

This is a long-term passion project currently in collaborative development, with plans to release a small playable demo within the next 8 - 12 months, serving as a proof of concept for potential funding and community interest.

Personal Website

Link: https://adrtg1.github.io/Website/

A personal site built to serve as a digital hub for my portfolio and project documentation. 
The code is kept private, but the site demonstrates:
-  Foundational proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through practical implementation.
-  The development process was supported by independent research, including various online instructional resources. 
-  The project reflects an applied understanding of core web development concepts and a commitment to self-guided learning.

While it's a beginner-level project, it helped me understand the fundamentals of structuring web pages, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

Animated To-Do List 

A simple and classic front-end project, the To-Do List with a modern, cozy theme. 

- Simple HTML structure
- CSS for styling and animation
- JavaScript for interactivity and data persistence via LocalStorage
  Animated Task completion Line using CSS keyframes
- The development process was supported by independent research, including various online instructional resources. 

Yet another simple beginner-level project to showcase my learning from zero knowledge of programming to current completion of projects
