# Adrian – Projects & Documentation Hub

Hi! This GitHub repository is a curated collection of my personal and collaborative projects, where I document my development process, share prototypes, and reflect on work in progress.

Here you'll find:
-  **Work-in-progress builds** — from independent game development to research-based initiatives  
-  **Completed projects** 
-  **Behind-the-scenes files** 

This space serves as both a portfolio and a living lab for experimentation — spanning across my interests in Management, design, social impact, and creative tech.
