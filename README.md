# Adrian – Projects & Documentation Hub

Hi! This GitHub repository is a curated collection of my personal and collaborative projects, where I document my development process, share prototypes, and reflect on work in progress.

Here you'll find:
-  **Work-in-progress builds** — from independent game development to research-based initiatives  
-  **Completed projects** 

This space serves as both a portfolio and a living lab for experimentation, spanning across my interests in Management, design, social impact, and creative tech.

Personal Website

A personal site built to serve as a digital hub for my portfolio and project documentation. 
The code is kept private, but the site demonstrates:
-  Foundational proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through practical implementation.
-  The development process was supported by independent research, including various online instructional resources. 
-  The project reflects an applied understanding of core web development concepts and a commitment to self-guided learning.

While it's a beginner-level project, it helped me understand the fundamentals of structuring web pages, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.
