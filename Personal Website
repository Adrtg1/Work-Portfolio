## Personal Website

A personal site built to serve as a digital hub for my portfolio and project documentation. 
The code is kept private, but the site demonstrates:
-  Foundational proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through practical implementation.
-  The development process was supported by independent research, including various online instructional resources. 
-  The project reflects an applied understanding of core web development concepts and a commitment to self-guided learning.

While it's a beginner-level project, it helped me understand the fundamentals of structuring web pages, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.
